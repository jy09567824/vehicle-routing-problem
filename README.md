# Vehicle Routing Problem
## Introduction
This project includes multiple algorithms to solve the Vehicle Routing Problem (VRP) and its variants. The VRP is a combinatorial optimization and integer programming problem which asks "What is the optimal set of routes for a fleet of vehicles to traverse in order to deliver to a given set of customers?". It generalizes the well-known Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP).
